This is an unfinished compiler for a toy language called CD20 that is to be run in a toy stack machine called SM20. The Lexical Analysis and the Parsing has been completed and tested. Code Generation is incomplete.

README:

The Parser is in the folder called "part2_parser". In this directory you use the "javac A2.java" and "java A2 source.txt" commands, where "source.txt" would be the name of the text file you wish to input.
